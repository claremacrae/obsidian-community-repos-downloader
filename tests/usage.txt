                        that will be downloaded. This is useful when testing
                        the script. 0 (zero) means "no limit". Note: the count
                        currently includes any repos already

                        GitHub user. For example, the plugin
                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0/obsidian-tabout"
  --no-group-by-user    Put each repository in the same folder, prefixed by

                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0-obsidian-tabout"
