                        already exist. (default: . which means "current
                        working directory")

                        Limit the number of plugin and theme repos that will
                        be downloaded. This is useful when testing the script.
                        0 (zero) means "no limit". Note: the count currently
                        includes any repos already downloaded.(default: 0)

  --group-by-user       Put each repository in a sub-folder named for the

                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0/obsidian-tabout"
  --no-group-by-user    Put each repository in the same folder, prefixed by
                        the user name. This is the default behaviour. For
                        example, the plugin
                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0-obsidian-tabout"
