optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        The directory where repos will be downloaded. Must
                        already exist. Defaults to the current working
                        directory.
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        Limit the number of plugin and theme repos that will
                        be downloaded. This is useful when testing the script.
                        The default is 0, meaning no limit. Note: the count
                        currently includes any repos already downloaded.
  --type [{plugins,themes,all}]
                        The type of repositories to download: plugins, themes
                        or both. (default: all)
  --group-by-user       Put each repository in a sub-folder named for the
                        GitHub user. For example, the plugin
                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0/obsidian-tabout"
  --no-group-by-user    Put each repository in the same folder, prefixed by
                        the user name. This is the default behaviour. For
                        example, the plugin
                        "https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-tabout" would be
                        placed in "plugins/phibr0-obsidian-tabout"
